Once qwerStaking starts accepting deposits, deposits/stakes will be accepted for 24 hours. Or any number of hours as specified.
After accepting time is over qwerStaking will stop accepting deposits/stakes.
The staking period is 30 days if startStakes(30 days, 24 hours) is called.
At the end of the month the manager will call distribute Rewards method. This will divide all the contract reward balance proportionally to all stake holders. Rewards plus the original stake amount will be returned to the stake holders.
After this, the manager may start the staking again by calling startStakes
And may call for 60 days, 24 hours. So users can deposit till 24 hours and their deposit will be staked for 60 days. Rewards will accumulate for 60 days and distributed.
